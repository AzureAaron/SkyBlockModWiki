# How to Install Mods
This guide is written for Minecraft 1.8.9. A guide for newer versions will be written once Hypixel and mod developers start to support them.

## Install Java
Java is required to run the Minecraft Forge installer. Please install the latest version from Oracle [here](http://java.com/download).

## Install Minecraft Forge
Minecraft Forge is a mod loader that provides basic functionality that all mods depend on. You need to install Forge before installing any mods.

1. Close the Minecraft Launcher if it is open. The Minecraft Forge installer changes a file in the launcher so it might break if the launcher is open.
2. Download Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.8.9 from the [Minecraft Forge website](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9/forge-1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9-installer.jar).
3. After the download starts, your browser will warn you that the file may harm your computer. This warning displays for all downloaded Java programs. Minecraft Forge is safe so you can click "Keep File" or "Trust File". The text may vary depending on the browser.
4. Double-click the file you downloaded and the Minecraft Forge installer should open. If your computer asks you to select a program to open the file, please make sure Java is installed.
5. Don't change any of the options on the installer screen and click "OK" to begin the installation. It will start the installation and show a prompt when it's finished. Click "OK" to close the installer.

## Creating a Minecraft Launcher Profile
We recommend creating a new launcher profile to store your Minecraft Forge settings in a separate folder. If you store the settings for different Minecraft versions in the same ".minecraft" folder, the different versions will overwrite each others' settings and the game will stop working.

1. Open the Minecraft Launcher. After Minecraft Forge is installed, you may see a new profile named "forge"  with a furnace icon to the left of the "PLAY" button. We will not use this profile since it may be overwritten if you install a different Minecraft Forge version.
2. Click the "Installations" button at the top of the launcher.
3. Click "New installation." A prompt will appear with a list of options for the new profile.

4. Set the `Name` option to the name you want for the new installation. It is set to "Minecraft Forge 1.8.9" in the screenshot above.
5. Set the `Version` option to "release 1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9". Click the text box, start typing "forge", and it will show that option as a suggestion you can click on. Click on the suggestion and it'll set the option for you.
6. For the `Game Directory` option, click "BROWSE" beside the text field and a file picker will open.
    1. **Windows**
        1. Click the "Roaming" folder to select it.
        2. Click "Make New Folder" in the bottom left and give the new folder a name, like ".minecraft-1.8.9". Click to the right of the name text box to set the folder name.
        3. Make sure the new folder is selected and click "OK". The folder path should now appear in the "Game Directory" text box.
    2. **macOS**
        1. Right-click the "assets" folder and click "Show in Finder". A new Finder window will open.
        2. In the new window, click "minecraft" at the top middle and click "Application Support" in the menu that opens.
        3. Click the three dots to beside the search icon in the top right corner of the window and click "New Folder".
        4. Enter a name for the new folder like "minecraft-1.8.9" and press Enter to set the name.
        5. Go back to the Minecraft Launcher and click "minecraft" with a folder icon beside it. The button should be located to the left of the search bar. Then click "Application Support" in the menu that opens.
        6. In the far right column, scroll down until you see the new folder you created. Click on it to select it and press "Open" in the bottom right corner of the window. The folder path should now appear in the "Game Directory" text box.
7. Click "Save" in the bottom right corner of the window to save your new profile.
8. Hover over your new profile and click "Play". Wait for the game to reach the main menu to make sure it runs correctly. If it runs correctly, you can now install mods.

# Choose a Default Minecraft Launcher Profile
You can set the default launcher profile, which is launched when the big "PLAY" button is pressed on the launcher's main page.

1. On the launcher's main page, click on the profile to the left of the big "PLAY" button. It is an icon of a block, like a crafting table, anvil, or furnace, with the profile name and version beside it.
2. Click on a profile from the dropdown menu that opens. You have now changed your default launcher profile.

# Install Mods
You can find mods at the mod lists linked on the [home page](../index.md).

1. Go to the "Installations" tab in the Minecraft Launcher and hover over the installation you created in the above section. Click the folder icon on the right and your game folder will open.
2. Go into the folder named "mods" or create it if it doesn't exist.
3. Drag the mods you downloaded into the "mods" folder.
4. Close the window and go back to the "Installations" tab. Hover over the installation from step one and click "Play" this time. The game will now start with your mods installed.
